# Cafe Landing Page
A simple and clean cafe landing page for portfolio use.

## Tools
HTML5
Vanilla CSS (utilizing flexbox and media queries)
JavaScript (for accessible "hamburger" navigation menu)

## Goals
- I am building this project to showcase my skills in writing accessible HTML and responsive CSS. 
- I will attempt to not get too bogged down in the "look" of the site as design is not my current area of focus. 
- I also plan to document the process as step-by-step as possible to demonstrate my understanding of version control and generally working with future use in mind.
