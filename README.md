# Cafe Landing Page
A simple and clean cafe landing page for portfolio use.

## Tools
HTML5
Vanilla CSS (utilizing flexbox and media queries)

## Goals
- I am building this project to showcase my skills in writing accessible HTML and responsive CSS. 
- I will attempt to not get too bogged down in the "look" of the site as design is not my current area of focus. 
- I also plan to document the process as step-by-step as possible to demonstrate my understanding of version control and generally working with future use in mind.

## Resources Used
- Reset CSS adapted from "A (more) Modern CSS Reset" https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/
- Cat photos by Tucker Good, Milada Vigerova, Caleb Woods (all via Unsplash)

## Known Issues
Still needs media queries for sizing, landscape mode
